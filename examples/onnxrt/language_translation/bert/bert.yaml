model:                                               # mandatory. ilit uses this model name and framework name to decide where to save snapshot if tuning.snapshot field is empty.
  name: bert 
  framework: onnxrt_integerops                       # possible values are tensorflow, mxnet, pytorch or onnxrt

quantization:
  approach: post_training_dynamic_quant              # optional. default value is post_training_static_quant.                                   
  calibration:
    sampling_size: 8, 16, 32

tuning:
  accuracy_criterion:
    relative:  0.01                                  # optional. default value is relative, other value is absolute. this example allows relative accuracy loss: 1%.
  exit_policy:
    timeout: 0                                       # optional. tuning timeout (seconds). default value is 0 which means early stop. combine with max_trials field to decide when to exit.
  random_seed: 9527                                  # optional. random seed for deterministic tuning.
